# Vietnam_GDP_Prediction_1985_2020
#### This notebook aims to analyze the GDP index of Vietnam from 1985 to 2020. Based on that, I will build a Linear Regression Model and Logistic Regression Model to predict the GDP index of Vietnam from 2021 to 2026. However, this is just a simple model. 
####  To build a regression model that can predict Vietnam's GDP, we need data on Vietnam's GDP and potential features that can influence GDP, such as export and import indices, investment indices, consumer indices, industrial production activities, and more.
#### All of these indices will be supplemented and incorporated into the model in the future.
